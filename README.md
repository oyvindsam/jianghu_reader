# jianghu_reader
Very simple novel reader app, very wip. Using JSoup to crawl novel sites. Currently only wuxiaworld "active" novels, but will add more in the future. 

Test .apk is in "Additional files" folder if you want to try, or build yourself. 

TODO:

-Fix scroll to top 

-Intent receiver on wuxiaworld domains

-Update and clean up ASyncTask with progress start stop

-Add favorites (with adding, saving feature) 

-MainActivity: show favorites, button to show all, support for different sites etc.

-Clean up chapter display (categories, sort)

-ScrollView: add snap text to screen border 

-Fix for not up-to-date links. (save last opened chapter?)

-Dialog to paste link to novel.
